## Segmentation Insights

High Value - Loyal customers generate the majority of revenue and exhibit frequent recent purchases.

High Value - At Risk customers contribute significant revenue but show declining recency,
making them prime candidates for targeted retention offers.

Low Value - Likely Churn customers show minimal engagement and low revenue contribution.
Aggressive retention spending on this group is unlikely to be cost-effective.

Segmentation enables prioritization of retention resources based on expected ROI rather than raw churn probability.
