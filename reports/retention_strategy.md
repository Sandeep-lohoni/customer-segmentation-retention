## Retention Strategy

Retention decisions are made by jointly considering churn probability and customer lifetime value.

High-CLV customers with high churn risk are prioritized for expensive retention interventions such as personalized offers or premium support.

Low-CLV customers with high churn risk are intentionally deprioritized to avoid inefficient resource allocation.

This strategy maximizes ROI by focusing retention spend where expected future value is highest.
