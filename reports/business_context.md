## Business Context

This dataset represents transactional data from an online retail business that depends heavily on repeat customers.

The business is concerned with:
- Identifying high-value customers
- Understanding customer purchasing behavior
- Predicting which customers are at risk of churn
- Allocating retention resources efficiently

Revenue is highly concentrated, meaning a small percentage of customers generate a large portion of total revenue.
Losing high-value customers has a disproportionate impact on business performance.

The goal of this project is to:
1. Segment customers based on behavior and value
2. Define and predict churn using behavioral signals
3. Estimate customer lifetime value (CLV)
4. Support actionable retention decisions
